# Digital Circuits

Digital circuits carry electrical signals, just like normal analog circuits. The difference between the 2 is that digital circuits only have 2 states: 1 or 0. Digital circuits is the foundation for binary and Boolean logic. They are the backbones of modern computers.

Digital circuits are made of multiple logic gates, which are devices that perform can perform Boolean logic. These circuits can perform mathematical calculations using just electrical signals.

# How digital circuits changed the world

Digital circuits, while they may seem not very useful at first glance, are the foundation for modern electronics and computers. They enable computers to process information and perform complex mathematics with high level of precision. 

These circuits allow us to build complex machines that can even simulate intelligence. So digital circuits are quite important for our modern world.

# Logic gates

These devices are the building blocks of digital circuits. They are capable of performing Boolean logic. They basically represent a Boolean function.

These logic gates can be connected to each other the same way Boolean logic can be cascaded together to perform complex Boolean algebra calculations and output precise results. 

Any algorithms and mathematics that can be describe with Boolean logic can be represented using digital circuits made up of logic gates. So a Boolean logic equation can be translated to a digital circuits, with each Boolean expression being represented by a logic gate.

# Types of digital circuits

There are 2 types of digital circuits: Combinational and Sequential

- **Combinational Circuits**: In this type of digital circuit, the output is reliant on the input it receives at an instant. This type of circuit will stay constant to its input.
- **Sequential Circuits**: In this type of digital circuit, the output is reliant on not only the input it receives at an instant but also the previous input that it received. The output generated from the previous input is transferred into the output of the current input
